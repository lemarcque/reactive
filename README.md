# reactive
Test of the frameworks RxJava 2

## Non-format definition
`Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams`
- _Stream_ : A stream is a sequence of observable events ordered in time. / The streams is the subject (or "observable*) being observed.
- _Obseravble_ : A collection of items over the time.
- _Subscribing_ : The operation of "listening" to the streams is called.
- _Observer_ : The object that listen to the event. The function (often callback) are observers.
- _FRP_ : Programming with reactive systems combined with functional operators.

# Benefits
FP Raises the level of abstraction of my code, so that i can focus on the interdependance of events that defune the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation details. __code in RP will be more consise__.
The benefits is more evident for modern webapps and mobile apps that are highly interactive with a multitude of UI events related to data events. Apps has evolved to be more real-time. App nowadays have an abundatly of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive experience to the users.
